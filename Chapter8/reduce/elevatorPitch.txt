Hi, my name is Laura Thon. I have been in the tech industry for over 15 years. I have worked in IT, systems administration, various analyst positions and programming. One position in particular, was a Java Programmer for a company called Autovin where I worked on a product called Lease Check which is the backbone to todayâ€™s AutoCheck, used by auto dealers. During my spare time, I have tried to keep up with front end development, wrote a few websites for some clients. 
In my last position, as a data analyst, I was exposed to Python programming and a newer version of JavaScript. Now, I am enrolled in a software engineering track at Springboard, learning the newest languages and programming practices.
My hope is to work at a company where I can apply my newly learned skills along with my past work experience in the tech field
